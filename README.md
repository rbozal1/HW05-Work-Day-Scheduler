I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.Later, I view the timeblocks for that day,and each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.So, when I click into a timeblock ,I can enter an event.Then,I click the save button for that timeblock and the text for that event is saved in local storage.Last, I refresh the page and  the saved events persist.
